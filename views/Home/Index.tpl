		<h3>Six-x  is an open source application development framework for PHP</h3>
		 Six-x is a toolkit for people who build web applications using PHP. 
		 Its goal is to enable you to develop projects much faster than you could 
		 if you were writing code from scratch, by providing a rich set of libraries 
		 for commonly needed tasks, as well as a simple interface and logical structure 
		 to access these libraries. CodeIgniter lets you creatively focus on your project by 
		 minimizing the amount of code needed for a given task.

		<h3>Six-x Uses MVC || HMVC</h3>
		 Six-x uses the Model-View-Controller approach, which allows great separation between logic and presentation. This is particularly good for projects in which designers are working with your template files, as the code these file contain.

		<h3>Light Weight && Fastes</h3>
		Truly light weight. The core system requires only a few very small libraries. This is in stark contrast to many frameworks that require significantly more resources. Additional libraries are loaded dynamically upon request, based on your needs for a given process, so the base system is very lean and quite fast.
